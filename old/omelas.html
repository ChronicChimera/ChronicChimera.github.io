  </head>
  <p>
    1. The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas is a thought-provoking allegory that explores the implementation of utilitarianism and the morality of sacrificing the happiness of a few for the greater good of the many.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. The story is set in the fictional city of Omelas, which is described as a utopia where the citizens live in abundance and enjoy a high standard of living.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Inexplicably, the city's prosperity and the happiness of its people is contingent on the suffering of a single child, who wastes away in a dark room, deprived of everything but basic nutrition.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. This story raises the question of whether or not we're morally obligated to intervene when we witness injustice, even if it means sacrificing our own happiness.
