			<h2>Theses</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>The story "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" presents a powerful philosophical thought experiment.</li>
				<li>The central question raised by the story is whether it is ever justifiable to cause suffering for the greater good.</li>
				<li>The narrator describes the city of Omelas as a utopia, but this utopia depends on the misery of a single child.</li>
				<li>The child's suffering is a metaphor for the suffering that exists in the world, which we often choose to ignore or accept as the price of our own happiness.</li>
				<li>The story raises the question of whether we have a moral obligation to intervene when we witness injustice, even if it means sacrificing our own happiness.</li>
				<li>The story implies that there is no easy answer to the question of whether the ends justify the means.</li>
				<li>The fact that some people in Omelas choose to walk away suggests that there may be an inherent human instinct to reject the idea of sacrificing one for the many.</li>
				<li>The story may be interpreted as a critique of utilitarianism, which argues that actions should be judged by their ability to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.</li>
				<li>The story also raises questions about the nature of happiness and whether it can truly be achieved at the expense of others.</li>
				<li>The story suggests that happiness that is built on the suffering of others is ultimately unsustainable and will lead to feelings of guilt and shame.</li>
				<li>The story challenges the idea that some lives are worth more than others and that the value of a life can be measured by its contribution to society.</li>
				<li>The story raises questions about the role of empathy in ethical decision-making.</li>
				<li>The fact that the story does not provide a clear answer to its central question is a strength rather than a weakness, as it encourages readers to engage in thoughtful reflection and discussion.</li>
				<li>The story is a powerful reminder of the importance of questioning our assumptions and recognizing the complexity of ethical dilemmas.</li>
				<li><strong>The story invites us to consider the limits of our own moral imagination and to strive for a more just and compassionate world.</strong></li>
                <li>Piss. And also... shit.</li>
